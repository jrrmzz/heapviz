HeapViz is a tool for generating PNG images using OnlinePythonTutor and webkit2png.  The latter dependency means it only works on Macs.

Prerequisites:

- Mac OS X 10.5+
- Python 2, accessible as 'python'
    - PIL
- Python 3, accessible as 'python3'

Usage:

First, run setup.sh to pull down a local copy of OnlinePythonTutor and webkit2png.  Now you can use the following to generate a PNG:

./heap2png.sh your_script.py [starting instruction]

...where "starting instruction" is the 0-based index of the instruction whose heap should be visualized.  If omitted, the heap of the last instruction will be drawn.
